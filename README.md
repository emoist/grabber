# grabber : Golang Command-Line-Interface Programme ðŸ‘‹

We would love you to code a Command Line Interface (CLI) in Golang that asks for a path to a local file and prints the size of the file.
It's a super plus if it could auto-complete the paths by hitting TAB, the same way bash does. 

```
$ ./hr_test stat
 > /path/to/local/file -> with auto-complete
```


## How to use
- Build
  go build -o grabber main.go || ./build.sh
- Run
  ./grabber size D:/abc.txt

## We can extend more and more features!
